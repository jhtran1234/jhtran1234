This is my first repository. Hello world!

Hi! The year is 2020, and amid the coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, I am here learning how to use GitHub. I have been coding since 2012 so this is long overdue, but you know what they say: better late than never!

Currently I am a Junior at the University of Maryland - College Park studying Computer Science and Economics.

A little bit about me: I started my coding journey back in 6th grade when I was accepted into Montgomery County Public School's magnet programs for Math, Science, and Computer Science at Roberto Clemente Middle School. There I was introduced to HTML, Pascal, Visual Basic, Python, and others, the highlights of which are up on this GitHub now :).

I have been coding ever since, picking up JavaScript, PHP, Java, C, Ruby, OCaml, and more friends along the way! It has been an amazing journey, and I look forward to the future!

My hobbies:
- working on my 2003 Toyota Camry and 2006 Toyota Sienna
- product reviewing on Amazon.com (I have received for free and reviewed vacuum robots, smartphones and accessories, camping gadgets, and everything in between!)
- camping and crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay
- coin collecting
